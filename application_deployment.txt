Docker hub:
● Create 2 repos “dev” and “prod” to push images.
● “Prod” repo must be private and “dev” repo can be public

Jenkins:

● Sending notifications only if the application goes down is highly appreciable

Submission:
● Github repo URL, deployed site URL, docker images name must be added in the submission
● Upload the screenshots of below mentioned to github repo:
   o Jenkins (login page, configuration settings, execute step commands)
   o AWS (EC2-Console, SG configs)
